# Employee password generator

## Description

User is asked to enter password length:
![start](images/start.jpg)

After that user have to answer 4 questions about their character choices (each of them displayed one by one in separate pop-up windows):
![questions about characters](images/characters.jpg)

Once all questions answered, pop-up window disappears, user needs to press "Generate Password button, and his new password will be displayed:  
![password generated](images/success.jpg)


However if user chose wrong length for his password(less than 8 or more than 128 characters), they get a message:
![incorrect length](images/numFalse.jpg), 
they need to start again.

Also, if a user's answer about characters to all four questions is no, they get an error message, saying they need to refresh and choose at least one character option:
![did not choose any characters](images/charFalse.jpg)

I made this app to practice JavaScript:
- using functions
- accessing values
- making decisions 
- using loops
